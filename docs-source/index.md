## What is idemeum?

### Identity Platform

Application developers outsource login flows end to end to us. We do not provide you with numerous tools, SDKs, and APIs to built embedded auth. We value your time and abstract all this complexity: implementing auth flows, security, scalability, privacy. We give you one SDK to connect to idemeum and implement auth for your apps. 

### Identity Provider

idemeum is an **[Identity Provider (IDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider)**. We provide Single Sign-On to user across applications and domains. Once users login with idemeum to an application, the session gets created, so that users can seamlessly login to any other application that supports idemeum. 


### Passwordless

No traditional login experience for idemeum. We are passwordless end to end. Our goal is to remove friction for your users and help you build trusted relationship with your customers. 

### Private by design

We are the only **SSO Identity Provider** that offers users privacy with their digital identity. No, we do not use blockchain ðŸ˜€. With our mobile app we offer a decentralized model where digital identity data is only stored on users' devices. With our cloud we also designed a privacy preserving infrastructure so that only end users have access to their data. [Read more](/overview/privacy/). 

## idemeum login flows

To achieve our vision, we developed a platform that offers several passwordless services. Check our documentation to learn more about each flow. We also have a comparison table here. 

### [**One-click login**](overview/oneclick.md)

Simplest form of authenticating idemeum users into web, native, and mobile applications. One click login leverages asymmetric crypto key pair to authenticate users. 

### [**Biometric login**](overview/biometric.md)

Seamless authentication coupled with security of biometrics. Biometric login is based on [FIDO2/Webauthn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn) behind the scenes.

###[**Login with idemeum app**](overview/loginapp)

Most secure, and most importantly 100% private authentication method. Your phone becomes your personal identity hub - all  identity claims and information are stored in the idemeum app only.
