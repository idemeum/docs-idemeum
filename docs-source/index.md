# Let's begin your passwordless journey

**idemeum is a passwordless and private identity platform.**

Basically, it is a drop in [SDK](reference/sdkoverview/) to make your mobile and web apps passwordless. One SDK, couple hours of your time, and you can delight your users with seamless and simple login experience.

## How is idemeum different?

#### Passwordless

We are passionate about passwordless. That is why we built an all-in-one SDK to eliminate passwords. You choose how you wan to log your users in - with [one-click](overview/oneclick/), [biometric](overview/biometric/), or [QR-code](overview/loginapp/).

#### Private

Your users' data is none of our business. With client side encryption and [privacy](overview/privacy/) from ground up we enable your users to own and control their digital identity. We do not want to be yet another 3rd party sucking in your data. 

#### User centric

We designed idemeum to remove login friction. With features Single Sign-on across domains we want your users to not even notice that they are in fact signing up and logging in. Seeing is believing, try our [live demo](https://jsdemo.idemeum.com).
