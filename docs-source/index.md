# Welcome to idemeum documentation :sparkles:

## What is idemeum? 

idemeum is a **passwordless private digital identity platform**.

Our vision is to enable people and online services to go passwordless. We are tired of dealing with password resets, compromised accounts, and awful user experience. We dream the world where identity becomes passwordless, portable, and private.

To achieve our vision, we developed a platform that offers several passwordless services:


1. [**One click login**](overview/oneclick.md) - simplest form of authenticating idemeum users into web, native, and mobile applications. One click login leverages asymmetric crypto key pair to authenticate users. 
2. [**Biometric login**](overview/biometric.md) - seamless authentication coupled with security of biometrics. Biometric login is based on [FIDO2/Webauthn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn) behind the scenes.
3. [**Login with idemeum app**](overview/loginapp) - most secure, and most importantly 100% private authentication method. Your phone becomes your personal identity hub - all  identity claims and information are stored in the idemeum app only.
