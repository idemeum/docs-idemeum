# Start building with idemeum

![Overview banner](/assets/SDK/overview-banner.png)

idemeum makes it very easy to implement authentication for your app. We have various SDKs that you can use to protect your ***Single-Page***, ***Dynamic***, or ***Mobile*** application. You can explore SDKs, sample apps, and integration guides. 

## Single-page application
Integrate idemeum with your [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) application that is running entirely in the browser.
