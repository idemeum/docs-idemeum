# Start building passwordless with idemeum

!!! Abstract "What app are you building? :construction_site:"
	idemeum makes it very easy to go passwordless with your apps. Choose SDK based on the application you're building - ***single-page***, ***dynamic***, or **mobile** application.
	
	For each SDK we will provide:
	
	1. **Integration guide** - for you to see how you can go passwordless in minutes. 
	2. **Sample app** - so you can play with it and see the user experience. 
	3. **SDK source repo** - so you can see how we did it.
