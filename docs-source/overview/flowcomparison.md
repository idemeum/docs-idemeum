* **User installs software** - whether your users will need to install additional software.
* **Where is identity?** - location where identity claims are stored. Digital identity can either reside in *Privacy Aware Dedicated Cloud* managed by idemeum, or it can reside on a mobile device. In both cases we enable user privacy with digital identity. [**Learn more**](https://blog.idemeum.com/idemeum-keeps-identity-secure-and-private/).
